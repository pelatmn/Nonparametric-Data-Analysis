# 📊 Statistical Analysis of Dependent and Independent Non-Parametric Datasets

## 📋 Overview

This project focuses on the statistical analysis of dependent and independent non-parametric datasets. The analysis includes various tests such as the Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman test, and Mann-Kendall trend test. The data sets are analyzed to determine if there are significant differences between groups or trends over time.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### 1. 📝 Datasets

- **Independent Data Set:** 
  - A study with 15 participants divided into three groups to measure strength gains after different treatments.
  - **Objective:** To determine if there is a significant difference in strength gains between the different treatment methods.

- **Dependent Data Set:**
  - A study analyzing the effects of animal companionship on the quality of life of 10 elderly male participants over four weeks.
  - **Objective:** To observe the impact of animal companionship over time on participants' life satisfaction.

    - **Q-Q Plot Results:**
      - Treatment 1 and 2 show data points aligned with the normal line, indicating normality.
      - Treatment 3 shows deviation from the normal line, indicating non-normality.
    - **Histogram Results:**
      - Treatment 1: Slightly positively skewed.
      - Treatment 2: Slightly negatively skewed.
      - Treatment 3: Significantly positively skewed.
    - **Box Plot Results:**
      - Treatment 3 has outliers, indicating non-normality.
      - Median lines of Treatment 1 and 2 overlap, suggesting no significant difference between them. However, Treatment 3's median does not overlap with others, suggesting a potential difference.

- **Statistical Tests:**
  - **Sign Test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:** Used to compare medians of Treatment 3 against a specific value.
    - **Results:**
      - **Sign Test:** p-value = 0.3125 > 0.05, median of Treatment 3 is not significantly different from 9.
      - **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:** p-value = 0.1726 > 0.05, median of Treatment 3 is not significantly different from 9.
  - **Mann-Whitney Test:** Conducted to compare differences between Treatments 1 and 3.
    - **Result:** p-value = 0.1547 > 0.05, no significant difference between Treatments 1 and 3 in terms of strength gains.
  - **Kruskal-Wallis Test:** Used to compare differences across all three treatments.
    - **Result:** p-value = 0.2566 > 0.05, no significant difference between any of the treatments in terms of strength gains.
